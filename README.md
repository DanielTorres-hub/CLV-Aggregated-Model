# CLV-Aggregated-Model
CLV calculated using the average revenue per customer based on historical transactional data.

Assumptions: Constant average spend and the same churn rate for all customers.

This method does not differentiate between clients and produces a single value for CLV at the global level. Later we will improve this estimate by making models for each axis of value, interest, etc. and their combinations.
